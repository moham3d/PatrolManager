# Product Overview

PatrolShield is a modern security management platform that redefines how security companies manage their operations. It moves away from disjointed manual processes to a unified, site-centric digital workflow.

## Core Philosophy: Site-Centric Operations

Unlike legacy systems that treat guards or incidents as isolated data points, PatrolShield anchors everything to the **Site**.

1.  **Site Creation**: A physical location is defined with specific boundaries (Geofencing) and requirements.
2.  **Zone Definition**: The site is broken down into specific zones (e.g., "North Parking", "Lobby", "Server Room").
3.  **Checkpoint Deployment**: Physical or digital checkpoints (QR Codes, NFC tags) are placed within zones.
4.  **Route Design**: Patrol routes are created by connecting checkpoints in a logical sequence.
5.  **Assignment**: Users (Guards, Supervisors) are assigned to the Site, granting them access to relevant data and tasks.

This hierarchy ensures that every action—whether it's a patrol scan, an incident report, or a shift clock-in—is contextually linked to the correct location.

## Key Capabilities by Role

### 👨‍💼 Site Manager
The Site Manager oversees the entire security operation for their assigned sites.
-   **Dashboard**: A high-level view of site health, active patrols, and recent incidents.
-   **Configuration**: Full control over site settings, zone creation, and user assignments.
-   **Scheduling**: Create and manage shifts to ensure 24/7 coverage.
-   **Analytics**: Access to reports on guard performance, patrol completion rates, and incident trends.

### 👮‍♂️ Supervisor
The Supervisor acts as the link between management and the field.
-   **Live Monitoring**: Watch patrol progress in real-time.
-   **Guard Tracking**: View current GPS locations of all on-duty guards.
-   **Incident Management**: Receive immediate notifications of reported incidents and manage the response (escalate, resolve, acknowledge).
-   **Task Assignment**: Assign ad-hoc tasks to specific guards.

### 🛡️ Guard
The Guard is the boots-on-the-ground user, relying on the mobile app for their daily duties.
-   **Patrol Execution**: Step-by-step guidance through patrol routes.
-   **Checkpoint Verification**: Scan QR codes or NFC tags to prove presence at specific locations.
-   **Incident Reporting**: Quickly report issues (theft, damage, safety hazards) with attached photos.
-   **Emergency SOS**: A dedicated panic button to trigger an immediate high-priority alert to all supervisors and managers.
-   **Offline Mode**: Full functionality continues even in basements or remote areas without signal; data syncs automatically when connection is restored.
