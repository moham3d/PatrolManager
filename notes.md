Guard UI Enhancements

Pull-to-Refresh: Implemented! You can now pull down on the schedule list to refresh data. (Updating build dependencies to support this).
Proposed Additional Sections: Based on the Guard Persona, I recommend adding:

⚠️ Incident Reporting: A dedicated floating action button (FAB) or tab to quickly report issues (Broken lights, open doors) with photo upload.
🔔 Notifications: A section for urgent alerts from the Control Room (e.g., "BOLO: Suspicious Vehicle").
👤 Profile & Stats: To view shift duration, distance walked, and sync status (Offline/Online).
💬 Chat/Messages: Direct line to the Supervisor.
Shall I proceed with Incident Reporting next?
